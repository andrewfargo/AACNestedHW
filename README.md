### Purpose

According to the AAC homework specifications, augmented and alternative communication devices enable
those who have speech impairments. This project explores one approach, a high-tech one, that
allows a user to add categories of images and related text.

The primary goal of this assignment, however, is to explore implementation of abstract data types into
a larger project. Namely, we modify and use our `AssociativeArray` type from Mini Project 4 to define
associations between images and text.

### Sources Consulted

My implementation of the `AssociativeArray` is derived from Mini Project 4: Associative Arrays.

Thinking to pass `Class<T>` as a parameter in generic array creation comes from this StackOverflow question: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/529085/how-can-i-create-a-generic-array-in-java)

Instructions for implementation were taken from Catie Baker's assignment site: (https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AAC.html)

Instructions for project setup were taken from Samuel Rebelsky's specification: (https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/mps/mp05.html)

Information on `File`, `Scanner`, and `PrintWriter` was all sourced from Java 17 documentation.
